Responsive Bootstrap Portfolio

..This project is to create a screen size responsive portfolio site that looks good and functional on a number of common screen sizes using Bootstrap to both save time with templates and to learn how to make the basic tools provided into a  custom site. Yeehaw.

## Goals:
* Make this quickly
* Take a look under the hood at how Boostrap is styled
* Let go of some control and let Boostrap do the work
* Try to be as "lazy" as possible and see where Boostrap can do the math for me
